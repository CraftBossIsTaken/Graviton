# Graviton

⚠️ PROTOTYPE

This game was made for Game Off 2025 and was not finished in time. It shouldn't be treated seriously and even though it looks decent on surface it has quite literally close to no gameplay. I myself wouldn't even recommend playing it, but I spent a lot of time on it regardless and wanted to share it.


Your ship barely survives an asteroid impact, only for you to wake up to something far worse.
You’ve drifted dangerously close to a black hole.

Manage the last remains of your backup power and hope you can withstand its gravitational waves. Avoid the asteroid orbits and navigate with most of the ship’s crucial systems down. 

What actually works other than the already very visible stuff: 
- Resource allocation (Only engine, automation and sensors are functional in gameplay)
- Dematerializer minigame (is the giant image in steering room and upon interacting locks onto nearby satellites to consume power)
- Gravitational waves (system is fully implemented but there is only 1 in the pool, which increases the gravity significantly).

The original vision
I was hoping to create a sort of strategy experience with a lot more stuff like manually fixing ship components, automated robots patching up holes in the ship depending on allocation, and much more. Generally just making an interesting experience around the idea of allocating power to different parts of the ship. This turned out to not only in reality be boring but also very hard to make any gameplay with and that's how we got here. At fault is likely me being unable to allocate time to the stuff that actually matters (If i recall correctly dematerializer alone took nearly 4 days) as well as simply not enjoying the project after seeing that it doesn't have any gameplay. This is far from my first time making a game yet somehow I don't think I could list a single project of mine that was actually fun to play, and that happening again ended up hurting the motivation too. 
I had some high hopes for this, but they were never really fulfilled.
